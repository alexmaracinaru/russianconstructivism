        But at that time there were thoughts that art should not be reserved for
        the upper class. That art can be constructed, abstract, without
        ornaments, new and provocative – and for the people.One might argue that
        Russia first came up with the new modernist ideas. Russian futurism
        served as the basis for the new art form. It initially led to Russian
        constructivism and later to 'der Stijl' and 'Bauhaus' in the West.
        Bauhaus is today considered to be the cradle of modernism.

        Within constructivism this meant that, in essence, the expressive
        personal touch was rejected, looking away from the illustrative and
        hand-made expressions.One sought for pure and universal expression. Ie.
        ornaments were removed from the design and they saw the simple geometric
        shapes as an objective reality in itself. It was created by the Russian
        avant-garde but quickly spread to the entire continent. Constructivism
        influenced architecture, poetry, music, and even the consumer market and
        became the new everyday life in Russia of the time.

      <h1><strong>Stalin and the movement</strong></h1>
      <p>
        In the mid-1930s the end of Russian constructivism began when Stalin
        ordered art to be realistic and not abstract, ie. the opposite of
        constructivism's foundations and ideas, which were instead replaced by
        socialist realism

        <h2><strong>El Lissitzky</strong></h2>
        <p>
          El Lissitzky (1890 - 1941) is one of the most influential and famous
          designers from the period. He uses primary colours and geometric
          shapes in the belief that this would be the new universal visual
          language that would be understood by everyone.

        <blockquote>
          "One of our utopian ideas is the desire to overcome the limitations of
          the substructure, of the earthbound. We have developed this idea in a
          series of proposals. [...] The idea of the conquest of the
          substructure, the earthbound, can be extended even further and calls
          for the conquest of gravity as such. It demands floating structures, a
          physical-dynamic architecture."

        <h2><strong>Alexander Rodchenko</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Alexander Rodchenko (1891-1956) is another famous artist in Russian
          constructivism. He started his career painting, then he worked with
          graphic design, and later he worked with the photograph.His
          photographs were socially engaged and innovative. He often shot his
          photos from an unusual angle – high above or below to shock the
          viewer. He wrote:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "One has to take several different shots of a subject, from different
          points of view and in different situations, as if one examined it in
          the round rather than looked through the same key-hole again and
          again."

          />
        </p>

        <p>
          In his work on graphic design, he sought the unambiguous universal
          form. His work is characterized by its dynamics and energy.

        <h2><strong>Gustav Klutsis</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Gustav Klutsis (1895 – 1938) is claimed to together with Hannah Höch,
          Raoul Hausmann and El Lissitzky to have created the subgenre
          'Political photomontage'. A subgenre that originated in 1918. The
          ongoing theme in his works is propaganda and revolution. His first
          remarkable piece of work was a series of removable kiosks that were
          installed on the streets of Moscow in 1922. The kiosks were equipped
          with radio speakers, screens showing movies, and newspapers. The
          installation should mark the 5th anniversary of the Russian
          Revolution.

      <h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
      <p>
        The typefaces of Russian constructivism are typically geometric, clean
        and straight forms.. Headings can be crooked in an often diagonal
        expression.One sought for a universal and pure expression, where all
        ornaments were removed. Clean colours - and especially the primary
        colours - were to be preferred.In Russian constructivism, we especially
        see the red colours which became a symbol of the people's revolution. In
        addition, black and white, where the white is not a pure white but a
        cracked white, due to the fact that it did not print the white colour
        but let the paper shine through.The paper was not bleached white as we
        know it today but was more like a cracked white we know today from, for
        example, natural paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were often only two colours in a design used together with the
        black and chapped white. Strong graphic layout, simple and powerful in
        their expression.The layout can be both static in its structure ie.
        almost symmetrical or have dynamic and diagonal compositions. Sharp and
        geometric shapes characterize the design.Illustrations are not used in
        Russian constructivism, but on the other hand, photographs are used as a
        collage element. Posters often have strong messages.The street artist
        Shepard Fairey and the band Franz Ferdinand are some of the contemporary
        artists who have clear and direct references to Russian Constructivism
        in their visual arts.But the term in today's context receives a
        different content and message than the highly propagandist and
        revolutionary message it had at that time of its origin.
